Design and Develop SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym
CREATE DATABASE demo_db;
​
USE demo_db;
​
CREATE TABLE employees (
emp_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
emp_name VARCHAR(50),
salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);
​
CREATE INDEX idx_empname
ON employees(emp_name);
​
CREATE VIEW high_salary_emp AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
- Insert some sample data

```sql

INSERT INTO employees (emp_name, salary) VALUES ('pratik', 600000);
INSERT INTO employees (emp_name, salary) VALUES ('om', 450000);
INSERT INTO employees (emp_name, salary) VALUES ('rhutik', 750000);
```

- - Test queries

```sql

SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM high_salary_emp;
```

- - MySQL has no SYNONYM, but you can simulate it with another VIEW

```sql
CREATE VIEW emp_syn AS SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp_syn;
